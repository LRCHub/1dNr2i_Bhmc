Morning's come, passions gone
If this love was really strong
I'd want her now, the way I did last night
But deep inside me I'm just dealin'
With the same old guilty feelin'
'Cause things sure do look different
In the cold, cold morning light

Somewhere a lonely clock strikes four
I'll sneak up and out the door
She'll pretend that she's asleep
Till I'm out of sight
I'll go home, an' I'll sneak in
Tell a lie about where I've been
'Cause things sure do look different
In the cold, cold morning light

That's what makes it all so lonely
Is that even when I'm home
I know I'll see her again, tomorrow night
Thrill cheats, until we've had our fill
Call it love until
We see it for what it is
In the cold, cold morning light

Somewhere a lonely clock strikes four
I'll sneak up and out the door
She'll pretend that she's asleep
Till I'm out of sight
Then I'll go home, I'll sneak in
Tell lies 'bout where I've been
Things sure do look different
In the cold, cold morning light

Things sure do look different
In the cold, cold morning light
