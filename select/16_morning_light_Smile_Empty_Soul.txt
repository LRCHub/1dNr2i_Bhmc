All the pain brings me down again
I'm falling to the floor
Drag myself through the dirt again
I'm heading for the door
I know it's there on the other side
The moon is setting slow
Use the best of my will to fight
This feeling's got to go
In the morning light
I'll start again with open eyes
And I feel alright, the pain is gone
I'm still alive
Try to stay as clean as possible
The dirt just won't come off
Pull myself to the window sill
See how much time I've lost
Dwelling on the mistakes I've made
My soul has paid the price
Times are hard in the perma fade
I never see things right
In the morning light
I'll start again with open eyes
And I feel alright, the pain is gone
I'm still alive
Is my soul supposed to bleed? It's happening again
And I'm feelin' so lost without you
It's getting hard to see, I hope it's not the end
'Cause I need your help to find the answer
In the morning light
I'll start again with open eyes
And I feel alright, the pain is gone
I'm still alive, still alive, still alive
