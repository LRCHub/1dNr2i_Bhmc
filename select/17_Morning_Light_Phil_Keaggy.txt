On a hill stands a cross, still shining fair,
As the sun when the night has turned into day,
Bright as day, still it shines bright as day.

And from it love's pure light,
Ever flowing to cleanse the heart, bring life,
Drive the sin far away,
See it wash it all away, far away.

To this cross eyes of men are ever turning,
Today just as they did in days gone by,
And for the love of God,
Their hearts are ever yearning
Like men at sea in search of morning light.

Awake, awake our hearts to hear the echos,
Your words resound at the dawning.
And all day we taste a love that is undying,
And all day in praise for the morning light.

Your words resound at the dawning.
And all day we taste a love that is undying,
And all day in praise for the morning light.
